# Wedding
My first personal MVC-project was this wedding site. 
As a product owner, I do see a lot of code in my everyday job, but don't get to code much myself.<br>

The aim was to create an MVC-application in ASP.NET to learn basic setups of the trade. The purpose of creating it was to provide myself and Lisa with an easy-to-use platform as a wedding RSVP-application.<br><br>

External providers via Oauth were created through Facebook, Microsoft and Google. As an addition, I let the users create a local login.<br>

<br>
What I learnt and experimented with during the project:
* GoogleMaps-styling (see Views/Start/Info)
* MDL-styling framework utilized throughout
* Responsive design with viewports Tablet, Phone and Desktop in mind
* Entity Framework
* SQL-database setup
* C#
* ASP.NET
* Some Jquery
* 
* Azure webjobs *(not in this repo)*
* Azure blobstorage and queue *(not in this repo)*

What I experimented with somewhat but didn't finalize:
* Google Matrix API, to be able to create a commuter-service for the guests
* Various small API's that I was too unskilled to implement
